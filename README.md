# myCodingWork
Coding work: C, C++, Ruby, and VHDL currently.

Github doesn't support file or folder uploads of 25mb or above, so could not post even a ZIP file of VHDL Project. Uploaded txt file of the main code for my VHDL Project for Brick Breaker and Pong. Shared link on where you can download file. Read the README for more details.
